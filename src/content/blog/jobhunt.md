## Job Hunt

Hello,

My name is Robert Craig.

I am a former Scrum Master looking to return to the role of Developer - specifically within the SaSS, Data Science & AI arena.

My areas of technical expertise are Ruby on Rails, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform, Linux

BSc Computer Science (Distinction) - 1990 & recently - Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification.

Ultimately, I intend to set up my own SaSS offering.

In the meantime, I have been tooling up in preparation for the past 2+ years and believe my current skill set would be of value in the market.

I have been out of the industry for the past few years due to ill health. I am now fully recovered & fit to work. More details below.

I am very much open to advice. I am keen to prove myself to the market & myself.

So, I am taking the advice I would give to a team member in a similar position & looking for a mid-level developer role to prove, enhance & consolidate my skills

My current view of the initial ideal role is as follows:

Short Term contract - 3->6 months within IR35
S.M.A.R.T deliverables
Just in case: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time Based
I accept there may be an element of scut work.
That is no problem in the short term as I prove myself.
I am particularly enthused by maintaining the tools/environment as well as using those tools.
I may be able to make a positive contribution in a DevOps environment.
I manage & maintain my own development/deployment environment from inception to live (GCP)
My focus is on automating, streamlining and hardening my environment to ensure quality and consistency.
The role may involve refactoring, remediation, documentation, test-coverage
Ideally, the role would provide exposure to SaSS, Data Science & A.I.
I would be particularly interested in a role supporting any of these areas.

Given I’d be an unknown quantity initially, I am likely to cost less than most.

Consequently, I would be open to opportunities within the Charitable/Public sector should that be relevant.

As I said, I am very open to advice and ideally could use coaching to navigate my return to the industry.

Might that be of interest to you or a colleague?

A brief chat would likely be invaluable as a reality and opportunity check.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks in advance.

Rob Craig

ADDENDUM:
I have been out of the industry for the past while due to ill health.

I am now mostly through all that and can provide medical proof if required.

The only issue is I have been left with some mobility issues in the form of sporadic and unpredictable pain when walking. It is manageable and will not affect my ability to fulfill my role - as long as it is desk-based.

My preference is that I would habitually/normally work remotely - however, it is perfectly feasible & reasonable for me to attend meetings as required/agreed - I’m assuming these would be London-based.
