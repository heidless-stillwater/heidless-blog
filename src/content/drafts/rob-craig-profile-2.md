Over the past 2-3 years my primary focus has been on building my own tech infrastructure to support a SaaS business in the Data Science and A.I. space.

While the right idea may prove elusive there is a great deal of generic functionality that can be researched & implemented in the meantime.

The process has proven to be both challenging & inspiring.

It has involved a significant amount of upskilling with the challenge being the amount & variety of bases that need covering.

My solid Computing Science background has proved invaluable here allowing me to focus on the 'how' rather than the 'what'.

Even the Google Analytics Certification was enabled by the undergraduate education in Statistics.

On that, I am particularly enthused by the potential of Machine Learning & A.I. which I will be exploring regardless on my employment situation.

## Goals:

- Develop & Release Customer Ready SaaS environments
  - The aim is to develop a full-stack production environment
  - Full generic SaaS functionality.
- Preparing infrastructure is readiness for viable idea.
- This will ultimately allow focus on the unique functionality rather than the generic framework.

## Tech Stack:

- **Ruby on Rails** - recently: v6 & v7 - previously: v5

- **Python/Pandas/Streamlit/Tensorflow**

- **React/Astro/NextJS/Typescript/Javascript**

- **Google Data Science Analytics**: (Certificate Completed)

- **Docker**: Particularly relevant to deployment to Google Cloud Platform

- **Google Cloud Platform**:

  - Application Deployment & Support:
    - **Cloud Run** (Dockerization)
    - **App Engine**
  - **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)**
  - **Cloud Storage**
  - **Secrets Manager**

- ### Linux - Ubuntu

  I handle my own DevOps/SysAdmin. e.g. I build/support my own Dev environments from scratch.

  The includes:

  - Windows Distro Management
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux (**WS**L)
    - I exclusing develop in Linux with my greatest familiarity being with **Ubuntu**.
    - I am particularly familiar with configuring, backing up & restoring WSL images to better manage dev envs and resource usage.
      - including **Cloud Storage** backup mgmt
  - Dev Environment config (**Ubuntu 20.04 & 22.04**)
    - **zsh**/oh-my-zsh
    - python (**pyenv** - Python Version Mgr)
    - **PostgreSQL**
    - **Google Cloud CLI**
    - **NVM** (Node Version Mgr)
    - **RVM** (Ruby Version Mgr)
  - **github-ssh**
  - **gnupg** - file compression
    - used to disguise platform specific credentials i.e. GCP/AWS
    - allows saving of encrypted credentials to GitHub which would otherwise be rejected.
  - **conda** (environment package mgr)
    - particularly useful for Data Science related projects
  - various cli utils:
    - **sublime**: gui editor
    - **atuin**: smart shell history
    - **dust**: graphical disk usage analyzer
    - **btop**: resource monitor
    - **zellij**: CLI terminal emulator
    - **tmux**: CLI terminal emulator
  - Other:
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Vercel, Netlify, Flask

I transitioned to Scrum Master 2014. Prior to that I was a Ruby on Rails developer.

I have since returned to Development.
